A collection of random puzzle-solving programs which might come in handy for puzzle hunts like the [MIT Mystery Hunt](http://web.mit.edu/puzzle/www/).

Also some puzzle authoring programs for helping write puzzles (some meaning "one or more").

Current programs include:

- `algxword` -- a tool for generating theme answers in [algebraic crosswords](http://www.crosswordfiend.com/blog/2011/04/23/algebraic-crosswords-cts-10/)
- `polyomino` -- a [polyomino](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyomino)-fitting program
